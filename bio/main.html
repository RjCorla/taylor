        <h1>My AutoBiography</h1>

        <p>
          My name is <strong>April Mae Rampas</strong>, I was born on April 18,
          2005 and I live in Quezon City. My father is a construction worker,
          and my mother passed away when I was six. We are four siblings in the
          family, and I am the youngest. I would say that we like to support
          each other, especially financially since my father didn't have enough
          to support our studies, even though we fight sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since my father couldn't support us when my mother passed away, my
          aunt once decided to adopt me for a year to support my studies. My
          experience there taught me to be independent at a very young age—not
          financially but emotionally—because every time I have an assignment to
          do, I have this thought in my mind:
          <i
            >"I have to do this assignment on my own because I am living at my
            aunt's and I don't want to be a burden"</i
          >, and this mindset helped me to do things on my own at a very young
          age.
        </p>

        <p>
          This mindset is continuous; it guides me to be a player and a
          decision-maker in my own life. But not all the time my decisions were
          right; there are many failures I have come through, and there are more
          obstacles that I will face in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being a child who didn't receive enough love and care from a mother
          sometimes feels like being really sad and lonely, but at the same
          time, I am really grateful that I have a father, siblings, relatives,
          and peers to share my problems with every time I have a really bad
          day, I was happy and thankful that my family is there to guide me as I
          reach my dreams as I enter this new journey in my life.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>

        <p>
          <strong><i>Taylor Swift</i></strong> is one of my favorite artist and
          an inspiration. Listening to her songs when I am in a bad mood helps
          me ease the anger and sadness in my heart. She said once in her
          interview that
          <i style="color: purple"
            >"fearless is not the absence of fear, not being completely
            unafraid, that fearless is having fears and doubts, that fearless is
            getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again,
            even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost."</i
          >
          Such a wonderful and brave woman is worth being one of my inspirations
          to fight and let the fear be gone in my way and be one of my
          strengths.
