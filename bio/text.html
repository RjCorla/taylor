      Luzon (/luːˈzɒn/, loo-ZON; Tagalog pronunciation: [luˈson]) is the largest
      and most populous island in the Philippines. Located in the northern
      portion of the Philippines archipelago, it is the economic and political
      center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, Manila, as
      well as Quezon City, the country's most populous city. With a population
      of 64 million as of 2021,[3] it contains 52.5% of the country's total
      population and is the 4th most populous island in the world.[4] It is the
      15th largest island in the world by land area.

      The Visayas (/vɪˈsaɪəz/ viss-EYE-əz), or the Visayan Islands[2] (Visayan:
      Kabisay-an, locally [kabiˈsajʔan]; Tagalog: Kabisayaan [kɐbɪsɐˈjaʔan]),
      are one of the three principal geographical divisions of the Philippines,
      along with Luzon and Mindanao. Located in the central part of the
      archipelago, it consists of several islands, primarily surrounding the
      Visayan Sea, although the Visayas are also considered the northeast
      extremity of the entire Sulu Sea.[3] Its inhabitants are predominantly the
      Visayan peoples.
